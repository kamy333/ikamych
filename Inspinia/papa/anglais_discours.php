<!--        <h1>Tribute to My Father</h1>-->
        <p>Today, I speak with a heavy heart but filled with love and gratitude for an exceptional man: my father.</p>
        <p>For me, he was more than just a father. He brought joy, always ready to make us laugh and to make every
            moment
            pleasant. His optimism and cheerfulness were an essential part of who he was, and that is how I want to
            remember
            him.</p>
        <p>When I was a child, I admired him greatly. I remember him behind the wheel of his green Mercedes, the most
            beautiful car in my eyes, and he was its king. He was my role model, my rock, my hero.</p>
        <p>He had a natural charisma and knew how to make every encounter special, whether with his friends or mine,
            through
            his stories and humor.</p>
        <p>Even though life sometimes separated us by distance, our hearts remained close. In recent years, we spoke
            more
            often and every call was filled with love, especially when he greeted me tenderly: “My son, my son, how is
            my
            son doing!” These words will remain engraved in me.</p>
        <p>I will never forget the year spent in Paris with him, a precious moment during which I got to know him better
            and
            appreciate his presence. I am also very grateful to him for coming to Geneva year after year to bring us
            together, even when he was weakened, and for making that effort despite the difficulties.</p>
        <p>Today, even though his absence is painful, I will keep within me all that he has passed on to me. His love,
            his
            values, and his life lessons will accompany me every day. Dad, wherever you are, you will always remain in
            my
            heart. Rest in peace.</p>
        <p>I also thank Weslley, Geovani, my guardian angels, and Pablo, who made it possible for me to be here in Paris
            to
            celebrate you with all the love you deserve.</p>
        <p>Finally, I want to express my gratitude to Germaine, who played an important role in your life. She
            cherished,
            supported, and loved you fiercely. She watched over you like an angel, until the very end. For all that, I
            will
            be eternally grateful to her. Germaine, I am witness to the immense love that dad had for you and the joy he
            experienced in sharing his life with you. I thank you for all that you have done for him and for us.</p>
        <p>Today, I stand here with a heart full of memories and gratitude. My father, you will always remain my role
            model
            and my source of inspiration. Your memory will live on through every smile and every shared moment of
            happiness.
            Shalom, Dad.</p>
